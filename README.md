## Resources (textbooks, etc.)
 * Textbook: [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Wickham and Grolemund
 * [Git Guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) - Read this first!
 * [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) - Read Second.
 * [GitHub CheatSheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
 * [RStudio CheatSheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/): We'll being using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `stringr`, `ggplot2`, and `RMarkdown` heavily in this course.
 * the College of Idaho's RStudio Server at (https://rstudio.collegeofidaho.edu)
 * More readings and resources in the *Resources* folder of this repo
 * Similar textbook for Python based course: [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)

## Course Content
This course is about manipulating and visualizing data to gain insight and prepare the data for modeling or other purposes. We will cover the following topics:
* Data Import: csv, text, excel, html, databases, etc.
* Variable types
* Data Wrangling (manipulation) using:
  * dplyr - numerous dataframe manipulation verbs
  * tidyr - gather and spread
  * stringr - regular expressions in R
  * lubridate - manipulate dates and times
  * purrr and apply - functional programming
* Join operations
* Data Visualization:
  * ggplot2 for **standard** visuals
  * more advanced visualization types: ridgeline plots, etc.
  * plotly - interactivity and 3D plots
  * D3.js (mostly via R) - highly customizable, web friendly visualizations
  * Mapping

We won't cover the material in this order, since that would be pretty boring (the motivation is all at the end).

## Assignments
There will be no exams in this class. You will be graded on in-class participation, homework, and a final project with presentation.

### In-Class Activities
Each day we will extend our knowledge of how to manipulate and visualize data. This will be done by using combinations of new and old commands and ideas to accomplish daily tasks. Student's solutions (including partial solutions) will be shared and reviewed (aka **critiqued**). This requires all students to be engaged throughout the class (you can't just sit in the back and take notes in this course). You will be graded on participation and quality of solutions presented.

### Homework
There will be almost daily homework to practice what has been learned up through the day assigned. Be aware the homework will often require things learned on the day assigned as well as prior skills developed in the course, so it is essential to keep up with what's going on. Sometimes the homework will require completion or extension of in-class activites. Students will be required to present solutions they have for credit.

### Project
The course will require each student to complete a significant project involving the acquisition, cleaning, manipulation, and visualization of a complex data set. Due to the compressed nature of the Winter term, little class time will be devoted to the projects so expect to work on them outside class. On the last day of the term, students will present their projects, including discussing how data was acquired, what was involved in cleaning and formatting the data, why various visualizations were produced, and what has been learned from the visualizations.

## Grading
* In-class activities and participation - 30%
* Homework and presentation of solutions - 30%
* Project report and presentation - 40%
